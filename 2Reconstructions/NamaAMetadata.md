# Namapoikia Reconstruction Data

## Resolution

5.73 x 5.73 x 30 microns

## Field of view (reconstruction extents)

4.104 x 5.790 x 1.9740 cm

## Notes

1. Calcite class ends up including the edges of skeletal elements. This issue can be solved by increasing edge training -> so do so in the next week. 

## Measures

1. % Dolomite (done after deleting voxels that are related to the yellow epoxy; volume percent is calculated as number of voxels belonging to the class divided by the number of total voxels in the volume): 2.75251e+07
/ 1.73945e+09 = 0.015824
